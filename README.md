### Executive Summary

SuperLife Saving Lives’ product development team engaged YES SIR Consulting to propose a program that incentivises healthier behaviours and provides value to the customers and firm. The program is an application which promotes wellbeing and sun safety awareness with opportunities for hiking and outdoor activity groups. Initial best estimates of the proposed program price it Č243.937/year more competitively than current life products offered. However, risks and limitations are acknowledged and mitigation strategies have been recommended.

### Overview

SuperLife Saving Lives’ (SuperLife), a major life insurer in Lemuria, product development team investigated pairing health incentives and life insurance to achieve the goals of healthy behaviours, decrease mortality, increase sales and overall value to the firm. YES SIR Consulting has been engaged by Superlife’s Jes B. Zane and Pat Moneywize’s team to propose a program that will help achieve the goals.

YES SIR Consulting will provide recommendations and supporting analysis for a proposed product, the projected financial model and outcomes, the assumptions utilised to generate the projections, risks and limitations.

### Program Objective

Our program is dedicated to promoting outdoor activities to enhance the well-being of SuperLife’s policyholders, whilst ensuring the sustained growth for the firm. We aimed for the following objectives:
Incentivise healthy behaviours
Decrease expected mortality rates
Improve life insurance sales
Improve marketability and competitiveness
Add economic value to Superlife

---

### Program Design

Three interventions were selected in our program design, addressing specific aspects of out-door activities through the creation of fitness communities, sun safety awareness, and technological integration to maximise efficiency, engagement and effectiveness.

---

Proposed Program

>
* Hiking and outdoor activity groups:
>Leverages the abundant natural landscape of Lumaria, creating a platform for policyholders to immerse in nature and engage in physical activities that promote fitness and well-being

* Sun safety awareness:
>Compliments outdoor activity groups through recognising the importance of mitigating sun-related risks and including a comprehensive sun safety awareness campaign to educate and equip policyholders with the knowledge and tools to protect themselves outside.

>
* Well-being application:
>Creating a centralised well-being application with in-built awareness programs on sun safety, general well-being and hiking and outdoor opportunities.

---

Program Evaluation

We have created short term and long term program evaluation plans to monitor the effectiveness and impact of our program interventions.
>
Short Term
>Conduct annual reviews to track the number of participants engaging in hiking and outdoor activities.
>
Long Term
>Conduct 5-yearly reviews to analyse correlations between reduction in mortality and participation rates in outdoor activity groups.

### Pricing Methodology

* Significant disparities in historical mortality rates from the inforce dataset were found between smoking status and underwriting class

* ARIMA models were used to model inflation and interest rates
* A Cox Proportional Hazard model was used to capture relativities in modelling mortality rates

### Pricing Results

* The proposed product is priced according to policy type, age group, smoking status and underwriting class. When offered at the same price, SuperLife would expect to earn on average Č243.94 more from the proposed product than current offerings.
* Life expectancy is expected to improve; an individual aged 30 may also see an increase in life expectancy of up to 1.5 years.

<p align="center">

</p>

* Average incurred loss per policy on the central estimate of assumptions is expected to be Č3.65 before the addition of any profit margins.
* Sensitivity tests were conducted on prices assuming different levels of utilisation. All tested prices failed under extreme scenarios of low investment returns. The product may still perform well under high inflation if investment returns are healthy, due to the assumption that indexation is limited to 5%p.a. However, high inflation coupled with low returns sees the product incur the greatest total losses.

### Historical Implementation Savings
To better evaluate the effects the incentives would have on SuperLife’s mortality savings, projections of expected deaths, claims outgo and expense outgo where conducted on in-force policies over the past 20 years.

<p align="center">
  <img src="Images/HistoricalOutgoReduction.png" width = "800">
</p>

* Two assumptions on incentive utilisation levels were tested, with high utilisation assumption resulting in a 11.42% reduction in expected deaths, 10.53% reduction in expected outgo and low utilisation assumption resulting in 1.69% reduction in expected deaths, 1.55% reduction in expected outgo.
* Younger clients experienced the highest reduction in overall mortality and claims over the time of coverage, while older age groups experienced higher reductions in total expenses.
* The 45-49 age group experienced the greatest percentage reduction in total outgo. With this tapering off as we move towards the older and younger age groups.

### Assumptions

* Rates of investment return and inflation: Modelled from historical one- and ten-year spot rates and historical inflation rates using ARIMA modelling, with 95% CI intervals capped at the min and max historical values to model high and low-rate scenarios
* Indexation: The face value lump sum of the amount insured is indexed to inflation at a maximum of 5% per year.
* Expenses: Claims expense of Č5000 is assumed per policyholder. Intervention costs of Č155, derived from the upper-bound total costs for all incentives implemented.
* Death and mortality rate: The mortality rates are modelled according to discrete ages, assumed to be constant between ages.
* Key Assumptions to Costs: While costs of interventions may vary, the assumption is to take the upper limit of combined costs as a conservative measure. Unforeseen increases in recurring costs, translate to lower profit margins and even possible incurred losses. As demonstrated in sensitivity testing, scenarios in which rates of return differ to those expected will cause profitability to vary greatly.
* Lapse Rate: Historical Lapse rates by age group, policy type and gender were used.
* Interventions on mortality: Interventions are assumed to have an additive reduction in mortality rates, with levels of utilisation corresponding to different reductions in mortality. No utilisation leads to no reduction in mortality. A low level of utilisation corresponds to a 2.0 % reduction in mortality, while a high level of utilisation corresponds to a 13.4% reduction in the mortality rate. The central estimate is the average of the two limits, at a 7.7% reduction.

### Risks and Mitigation Strategies

Risks associated with the program were evaluated based on their likelihood and severity, and mitigation strategies were proposed. These are listed in the following table, for more detailed explanation of risks and mitigations please refer to the report. Note that severity classes in increasing order are (negligible, minor, major) and likelihood classes in increasing order of likelihood are (infrequent, occasional, frequent). The table below is a summary of the risk and mitigation, for more information on risks, refer to the full report at the start of the landing page.

| Risk | Likelihood | Severity | Mitigation |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| Pricing Risk | Occasional | Major | Dividing into age categories where similar samples of each age group can be bootstrapped. |
| Regulatory & Compliance Risk | Infrequent | Major | Audits of SuperLife's financial position and statements, periodic risk assessments. |
| Reputational Risk | Infrequent | Major | Sound risk assessment framework, PR team, reputation insurance. |
| Strategy Risk | Frequent | Major | Catering to young demographics, does not require smartwatches. |
| Longevity Risk | Occasional | Major | Use the most up-to-date mortality tables, using mortality-linked securities, longevity bonds, mortality swaps to hedge risk. |
| Inflation Risk | Frequent | Minor | Incorporation of indexation feature on sum insured to keep up with inflation, educating customers on how inflation impacts their coverage. |
| Operational Risk | Occasional | Minor | Continuous monitoring of app perfomance and user feedback, automate processes and streamline operations. |
| Underwriting Risk | Frequent | Minor | Hold larger reserves, clarify to clients the consequences of misrepresentation, train underwriters to be risk alert. |
| Cyber Risk | Occasional | Major | Partner with established software development companies, leverage proven system architecture with robust security. |
| Market and Liquidity Risk | Infrequent | Major | Preventative asset allocation, correct asset-liability management. |

### Ethical Considerations

SuperLife’s product development should follow the Life Insurance Code of Practice in Lumaria (the Code). Similar to the Australian Code, it requires life insurers to offer products and services to an accurate, transparent and high standards [Life Insurance Code of Practice, 2023].To adhere to this, the proposed program is a simple but effective solution. Since the program only introduces a new feature, the fundamental policy wordings and claims processes remain the same. Furthermore, the program involves a technological solution, hence there are ethical considerations on data and information privacy. The program will align to SuperLife’s data and risk framework to support the ethical use of data and prevent any leaks of customer information. It is also important to consider protected groups such as location and gender, YES SIR consulting has proposed pricing under different features, however SuperLife should consider Lumaria’s anti-discrimination laws and adjust pricing appropriately.

### Data Sources

The data sources that supported the analysis of the program included SuperLife’s inforce policies, Lumaria wikipedia page, and Lumarian economic and mortality data. External industry related research was also used to formulate the proposed program. 

---

### Limitations

Data limitations
* No data on in market wellness programs and their results, for example reduction in mortality, increase in competitiveness and changes in revenue.
* Hard to find data on the effects of incentives on different health conditions, such as smoking, cancer and other health conditions.
* Lumaria’s macroeconomic variables were on an annual basis, which caused the rate forecasting to have a lack of granularity. 
* Lumaria’s mortality table was a combined version for both genders which is unrealistic as females generally have a longer life expectancy than males. 
* In-force data set provided by Superlife had limited information on the health status of the insured and this limited the analysis on how chosen interventions would affect the mortality of each policyholder. 

Therefore, the above limitations suggest uptake and utilisation of the program may be inaccurate, thus further surveys or focus groups need to be conducted within SuperLife’s inforce policyholders to obtain an improved view of the program’s success. Furthermore, the data limitations may cause deviations between forecasted  and real returns. Hence, an expected versus actual analysis needs to be performed periodically to adjust pricing. With these ongoing measures, the proposed program can be refined to a greater extent.

### Conclusion

The proposed program combines incentivising healthier behaviours and providing value to the customers and firm. The program introduces an application which promotes wellbeing and sun safety awareness with opportunities for hiking and outdoor activity groups. The financial analysis indicates that under normal circumstances, the proposed program will fare better than traditional products. However, there are risks and limitations which have been acknowledged and mitigation strategies were recommended.
