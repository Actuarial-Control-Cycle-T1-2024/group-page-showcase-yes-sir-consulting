### Program Objective

Our program is dedicated to promoting outdoor activities to enhance the well-being of SuperLifeâ€™s policyholders, whilst ensuring the sustained growth for the firm. We aimed for the following objectives:
Incentivise healthy behaviours
Decrease expected mortality rates
Improve life insurance sales
Improve marketability and competitiveness
Add economic value to Superlife

---

### Program Design

Three interventions were selected in our program design, addressing specific aspects of out-door activities through the creation of fitness communities, sun safety awareness, and technological integration to maximise efficiency, engagement and effectiveness.

---

Proposed Program

>
* Hiking and outdoor activity groups:
>Leverages the abundant natural landscape of Lumaria, creating a platform for policyholders to immerse in nature and engage in physical activities that promote fitness and well-being

* Sun safety awareness:
>Compliments outdoor activity groups through recognising the importance of mitigating sun-related risks and including a comprehensive sun safety awareness campaign to educate and equip policyholders with the knowledge and tools to protect themselves outside.

>
* Well-being application:
>Creating a centralised well-being application with in-built awareness programs on sun safety, general well-being and hiking and outdoor opportunities.

---

Program Evaluation

We have created short term and long term program evaluation plans to monitor the effectiveness and impact of our program interventions.
>
Short Term
>Conduct annual reviews to track the number of participants engaging in hiking and outdoor activities.
>
Long Term
>Conduct 5-yearly reviews to analyse correlations between reduction in mortality and participation rates in outdoor activity groups.
